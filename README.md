<b> PHAETHON </b>

Phaethon is a 3D, multi-wavelength, continuum radiative transfer code that has been developed by  Dimitris Stamatellos in 2003. Phaethon is named after the Greek mythical hero.

The code has been optimised and mainly used for the study of the initial stages of star formation: prestellar cores of different shapes, and young protostars deeply embedded in their parental cores
